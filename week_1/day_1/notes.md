- a script is a program meant to run and do a job. In Python, scripts are saved as .py
- a source code is the human readable text you write ( the code ). Is the instructions python follows before it runs your program.
-
- print() is a python function(instruction) that displays text on the screen. 
- a string literal is the text inside the quotes, like "Hello dude!" Python treats it as data, not as a command. The command is the whole line: print("Hello dude!")
- an argument is the actual value i give to the function when i call it?
- Always close the quotes of a string literal.
- So: in print("Hello"):
    - print = the function 
    - "Hello" = the argument - in this case a string literal

- syntax - is a set of rules for how code must be written so Python can understand it. Syntax is grammar for programming languages. 
- syntax error - happens when the grammar is wrong, and python cannot understand the code structure. The program cannot start running. 

- runtime error - this happens after the program starts running, when python hits something it can't do. 
Analogy : You started cooking, but midway you realize an ingredient is missing.

runtime error is a category of errors: NameError, TypeError, ValueError, etc.
NameError is a kind of runtime error

when we print(Hello) - python thinks that Hello is a name (function name/ a variable). Variable is taught tomorrow

- git init should not be entered multiple times. Once per project is enough
- add each file like : git add week_1/day_1/[file name] and then commit everything from that stage.
- git log shows the list of commits you have done. Using git log --oneline is clean and easier to read.
